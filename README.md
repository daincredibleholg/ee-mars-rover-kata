# EE Mars Rover Kata

## Problem Description
You are part of the team that explores Mars by sending remotely controlled vehicles to the surface of
the planet. Develop an API that translates the commands sent from earth to instructions that are
understood by the rover.
When the rover touches down on Mars, it is initialised with its current coordinates and the direction
it is facing. These could be any coordinates, supplied as arguments `(x, y, direction)` e.g. `(4,
2, EAST)`.
